Exisiting ARIMA Drawbacks:

Focus on complete data: 
missing or corrupt data is generally unsupported.
Focus on linear relationships: 
assuming a linear relationship excludes more complex joint distributions.
Focus on fixed temporal dependence: 
the relationship between observations at different times, and in turn the number of lag observations provided as input, must be diagnosed and specified.
Focus on univariate data: 
many real-world problems have multiple input variables.
Focus on one-step forecasts: 
many real-world problems require forecasts with a long time horizon.

1) MLP
Drawback: Feed-forward neural networks do offer great capability but still suffer from this key limitation of having to specify the temporal dependence upfront in the design of the model which is unknown.
2) CNN
3) LSTM
4) CNN-LSTM
5) LSTM Multi Step Forecasting
================================================

TO DO: 

1) Hyper
2) Mention LSTM not suitable by non peer reviewed source mention in literature review.

3) Use Sliding window 
4) Structural break
5) Stacked Generalization
