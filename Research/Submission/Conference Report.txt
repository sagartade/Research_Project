Can an hybrid of ANN-GARCH model provide a significant improvement in predicting the price volatility of the Ethereum?
======================================================
Abstract:

Ethereum the second most popular cryptocurrency next to Bitcoin has a market share of US $18 billion. Due to its huge market shares, Ethereum has gained attention from the investor community. With its unique ability to write smart contracts for blockchain technologies, it is very popular among the application developers community. Even after having a significantly large fan base, there is very little academic research being done on this cryptocurrency. This research paper aim towards finding out if the hybrid model consisting of ANN-GARCH can provide significant improvements in predicting the price volatility of such popular and volatile cryptocurrency. This research intends to contribute to a better understanding of the ability of the GJR-GARCH model to predict volatility with a rolling window approach. These results when fed to the LSTM model for training and closing the gap between the actual and forecasted volatility values of the GARCH model yield interesting results. After, many iterations and tuning of the GARCH and LSTM models, it was observed that the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) was significantly less in comparison with standalone GARCH model. When compared the RMSE with standalone LSTM model the difference observed was very insignificant. This means that the LSTM model is capable enough in predicting the volatility in the case of Ethereum. The question which remains after this research is what factors of GARCH models are preventing it from predicting the highly volatile asset and how it can be optimized for the same.

Introduction:

Cryptocurrencies have started gaining huge popularity after the 2008 crisis. With more than US $180 billion being invested in the cryptocurrency markets it is becoming one of the major asset class. <<References 1>> Increase in the popularity has attracted every individuals attention towards cryptocurrency market. Stories of people becoming millionaires over night are hyping up the interest of the investors and common people. Very high volatile and unregulated market of cryptocurrencies have enabled people in gaining huge profits in the recent years. On the other hand billions of dollars were lost due to same characteristics causing huge risks on the investors and fund managers creating a chaos. Thus various academicians are trying to solve the problem of predicting the volatility of such cryptocurrencies. Majority of the study is done across one cryptocurrency which is Bitcoin. Origin of Bitcoin was aimed towards overcoming the shortfalls and opaque systems of the traditional banking institutions. Underlying technology of Bitcoin which was termed as "Blockchain" had trust, privacy, transparency and integrity into it with the use of advance maths and technology. Thus the underlying technology of Bitcoin was a great inspiration for other cryptocurrencies and Ethereum in particular.
