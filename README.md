# GARCH_ANN_Masters-Thesis
This repository will consists of prediction of volatility for Ethereum by using hybrid techniques of GARCH and Artificial Neural Network. This is my Master's thesis work.

Ethereum the second most popular cryptocurrency next to Bitcoin has a market share of US $18 billion. Due to its huge market shares, Ethereum has gained attention from the investor community. With its unique ability to write smart contracts for blockchain technologies, it is very popular among the application developers community. Even after having a significantly large fan base, there is very little academic research being done on this cryptocurrency. This research paper aim towards finding out if the hybrid model consisting of ANN-GARCH can provide significant improvements in predicting the price volatility of such popular and volatile cryptocurrency. This research intends to contribute to a better understanding of the ability of the GJR-GARCH model to predict volatility with a rolling window
approach. These results when fed to the LSTM model for training and closing the gap between the actual and forecasted volatility values of the GARCH model yield interesting results. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of the GJR-GARCH model is 0.6986, RMSE of LSTM Model is 0.6071. Whereas, the RMSE for the hybrid model is 0.5894. This denotes that the hybrid model is good at reducing the error
thus predicting more accurately than the standalone models. The question which remains after this research is if it worth having a hybrid model to increase the performance by 2% or wait for some more time for Ethereum to generate sufficient data points to train heavy models likes of LSTM to yield better results.
